# CustomerShoppingExploratoryAnalysis
This is a tableau project.
An analysis on Customer Shopping Exploratory is performed from the dataset from Kaggle platform. It provides valuable insights into consumer behavior and purchasing patterns.
The insights which I got after performing the analysis are
1. When the frequency of purchases by the customers is annual, discount applied or not doesn't matter that is people purchase even if there's no discount.
2. If purchases are done weekly, more discounts should be provided for the sales to be improved.
3. More sales are done in medium (M) size .
4. Sales of XL size are less compared to other sizes available (S,M,L).
5. People prefer to spend more on clothing compared to accessories, outerwear, footwear irrespective of discounts provided.
6. Shipping type preferred by people from most preferred to least preferred- Free shipping, Express, Store pickup, Standard, 2-Day Shipping, Next-day Air.
7. Sales cannot be improved using promo codes technique as many people are still not using promocodes.
